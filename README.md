#### Surface-Expression-Of-Low-Basal-Friction
This repository shares the code associated with the drafted publication titled "Surface Expression of Low Basal Friction Under Antarctic Grounding Lines" which will be submitted for review to the Journal of Glaciology. We share code and data used for the modeling and the along-flow distance algorithm discussed in the paper.
